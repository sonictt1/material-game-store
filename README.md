A material design django-app store for you to sell game keys. Primarily intended for individuals to sell extra/duplicate keys from bundle deals. Please read the ToS on the sites where the keys originated before selling, unless you live in a jurisdiction where selling pre-owned software in protected by law. *Somes sites prohibit the resale of game keys.*

## Prerequisites
 
This app is intended to go into an already-existing Django project. It is not yet installable with `pip install`, but I'm working on that.
